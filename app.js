So What I want to do is wait until they hit a button

The first button that I am going to work on is submiting the name of the Movie

Once they do that their movie is going to be addd to the movieList with a movieKey

Once that happens I am going to have an arry that looks something like this
movieList = {
                1:'Transformers',
                2:'Pearl Harbor',
            }
movieKey = Object.key(movieList)

Is their any information that I will need?

All of the movies are going to be an object so this is going to make it easier for me to add more varibles
for example I am going to have a varible for if it is a favorite or not 

when decalring it in the movie class
favorite = false

When they click the favorite button
favorite = !favorite
*/ 

let numFilms = 0

class movieClass{
    constructor(mt,mID){
        this.movieTitle = mt
        this.movieID = mID
        this.favorite = false
        this.rank = mID + 1        
    }
    favButtonClicked(){
        this.favorite = !this.favorite
    }    
}
//so this is good but I want to have a list of these movies
movieList = {   ///'1': new movieClass('transformers',0),
                //'2': new movieClass('pearl harbor',1),
}
//So then I want to take all of the information in the movie list and output it? I guess

//movieList[movieKeys[0]]
//      This lets me acess each of the movies individually

//So the next thing that I want to do is to be able 
function updateMovieList(MovieName){
    movieList[(numFilms+1)] = new movieClass(MovieName,numFilms)
    movieKeys = Object.keys(movieList)
    numFilms = numFilms+1
}

//Instead of using the console to make it run the function how about I run the function when I click the button?
    
 //So this is working how I want it to 

//The next step is to enter some text in the text feild
//click the add flick button 
//then make it add the thing as a div

//Some problems that I am seeing already is that this is probably no the way that he would have wanted it
//I need to some how make it take the movieClass object and make it display the name, if it is hearted and what rank it is

const list = document.querySelector('#flick-list') //this is where the new thing is going to go

                    }//This is where I want to put all of the movies it will keep the ids and stuff so it should be preety good

//Insted of just giving what the text is i can give the full object and it can figure out what all of it is
